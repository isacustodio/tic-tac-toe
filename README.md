# tic-tac-toe

I chose to complete the test using Vanilla JavaScript instead of a framework like Vue.js due to my limited experience with Vue.js. While Vue.js is a powerful tool, I opted for Vanilla JavaScript to ensure I could deliver a high-quality solution without facing additional challenges associated with a framework Iâ€™m still getting familiar with. By using Vanilla JavaScript, I was able to focus more effectively on the problem's logic and provide a well-structured and functional solution.
